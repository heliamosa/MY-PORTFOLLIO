            Hi, I'm <strong>Helia Mosayebian</strong>, a **software developer** and **sales professional** based in **Plano, TX**.  
            With a background in **full-stack development (Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, React.js)** and experience in **business management & sales**,  
            I bring a unique blend of **technical expertise, adaptability, and client relations** to the tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey started in **sales and business operations**, where I worked as a **traveling sales contractor**  
            and gained extensive experience in **negotiation, customer acquisition, and market expansion**.  
            Driven by my passion for **technology and problem-solving**, I transitioned into software development,  
            where I now focus on **building scalable web applications** and **leveraging data-driven solutions**.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently obtaining a **Software Development License from SMU**, refining my skills in **backend & frontend technologies**  
            while working on a **Fitness & Nutrition Tracker** project, integrating APIs and user authentication with JWT.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive in **fast-paced, collaborative environments** and am eager to contribute to innovative projects  
            that bridge **technology, business, and user experience**.
